Installation
============

Prerequisites 
-------------
The T-Rex control plane is based on client-server model that interacts using JSON-RPC.

In order to use the client-side API documented a T-Rex server daemon must be up and listening on the same host and port that the client tries to connect with.

Compatibility
-------------
Both client and server side were developed for Linux platform.
The client-side module is also compatible with windows python.

The client side can be used with both Python 2 and Python 3 versions.
However, the server side was desined to and best fits with Python 2.7.6 and on (all 2.x series, assuming > 2.6.9).
