== Introduction

=== T-Rex traffic generator

T-Rex traffic generator is a tool design the benchmark platforms with realistic traffic.
This is a work-in-progress product, which is under constant developement, new features are added and support for more router's fuctionality is achieved.

=== T-Rex Control Plane

T-Rex control (phase 1) is the base API, based on which any future API will be developed. +
This document will describe the current control plane for T-Rex, and its scalable features as a directive for future developement.

==== T-Rex Control Plane - Architecture and Deployment notes

T-Rex control plane is based on a JSON RPC transactions between clients and server. +
Each T-Rex machine will have a server running on it, closely interacting with T-Rex (clients do not approach T-Rex directly). +
The server version (which runs as either a daemon or a CLI application) is deployed with T-Rex latest version, written in Python 2.7.
As future feature, and as multiple T-Rexes might run on the same machine, single server shall serve all T-Rexes running a machine.

The control plane implementation is using the currently dumped data messaging from T-Rex's core via ZMQ publisher, running from core #1.
The server used as a Subscriptor for this data, manipulating the packets, and re-encodes it into JSON-RPC format for clients use. +
Since the entire process is taken place internally on the machine itself (using TCP connection with `localhost`), very little overhead is generated from outer network perspective.

<<<

The following image describes the general architecture of the control plane and how it interacts with the data plane of T-Rex.

endif::backend-xhtml11[] 

The Python test script block represents any automation code or external module that wishes to control T-Rex by interacting with its server.

Such script can use other JSON-RPC based implementations of this CTRexClient module, as long as it corresponds with the known server methods and JSON-RPC protocol.

At next phases, an under developement integrated module will serve the clients, hence eliminating even the internal TCP messaging on the machine footnote:[updating server side planned to have almost no affect on the client side].

== Using the API

[NOTE]
Basic familiarity with T-Rex is recommended before using this tool. +
Further information can be learned from T-Rex manual: http://csi-wiki-01:8080/display/bpsim/Documentation[(T-Rex manual)]


=== The Server module

The server module is responsible for handling all possible requests related to T-Rex (i.e. this is the only mechanism that interacts with remote clients). +
The server is built as a multithreaded application, and **must be launched on a T-Rex commands using `sudo` permissions**.

The server application can run in one of two states:

  1. **Live monitor**: this will run the server with live logging on the screen. To launch the server in this mode run `server/trex_server.py` file directly.

  2. **Daemon application**: this will run the server as a background daemon process, and all logging will be saved into file, located at `/var/log/trex/` path. +
     This is the common scenario, during which nothing is prompted into the screen, unless in case of error in server launching.

==== Launching the server

The server would run only on valid T-Rex machines or VM, due to delicate customization in used sub-modules, designed to eliminate the situation in which control and data plane packets are mixed.

The server code is deployed by default with T-Rex (starting version 1.63 ) and can be launched from its path using the following command: +
`./trex_daemon_server [RUN_COMMAND] [options]`

[NOTE]
The [RUN_COMMAND] is used only when server launched as a daemon application.

Running this command with `--help` option will prompt the help menu, explaning all the available options.

===== Daemon commands

The following daemon commands are supported:

  1. **`start`**: This option starts the daemon application of T-Rex server, using the following command options (detailed exmplanation on this next time).

  2. **`stop`**: Stop the daemon application.

  3. **`restart`**: Stop the current daemon proccess, then relaunch it with the provided parameters (the parameters must be re-entered).

  3. **`show`**: Prompt whether the daemon is running or not.

WARNING: restarting the daemon application will **truncate** the logfile.

===== Server options commands

The following describes the options for server launching, and applies to both daemon and live launching. +
Let's have a look on the help menu:

----
[root@trex-dan Server]# ./trex_daemon_server --help
[root@trex-dan Server]# usage: trex_deamon_server {start|stop|restart} [options]

        NOTE: start/stop/restart options only available when running in daemon mode

Run server application for T-Rex traffic generator

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PORT, --daemon-port PORT
                        Select port on which the daemon runs. Default port is
                        8090.
  -z PORT, --zmq-port PORT
                        Select port on which the ZMQ module listens to T-Rex.
                        Default port is 4500.          #<2>
  -t PATH, --trex-path PATH
                        Specify the compiled T-Rex directory from which T-Rex
                        would run. Default path is: /  #<1> 

[root@trex-dan Server]#
----

<1> Default path might change when launching the server in daemon or live mode. 

<2> ZMQ port must match the defined port of the platform, generally found at `/etc/trex_cfg.yaml`. 

The available options are:

  1. **`-p, --daemon-port`**: set the port on which the server is listening to clients requests. +
  Default listening server port is **`8090`**.

  2. **`-z, --zmq-port`**: set the port on which the server is listening to zmq publication from T-Rex. +
  Default listening server port is **`4500`**.

  3. **`-t, --trex-path`**: set the path from which T-Rex is runned. This is especially helpful when more than one version of T-Rex is used or switched between. Although this field has default value, it is highly recommended to set it manually with each server launch.

[NOTE]
When server is launched is first makes sure the trex-path is valid: the path 'exists' and granted with 'execution permissions.' If any of the conditions is not valid, the server will not launch.


=== The Client module

The client is a Python based application that created `TRexClient` instances. +
Using class methods, the client interacts with T-Rex server, and enable it to perform the following commands:

  1. Start T-Rex run (custom parameters supported).

  2. Stop T-Rex run.

  3. Check what is the T-Rex status (possible states: `Idle, Starting, Running`).

  4. Poll (by customize sampling) the server and get live results from T-Rex **while still running**.

  5. Get custom T-Rex stats based on a window of saved history of latest 'N' polling results.

The clients is also based on Python 2.7, however unlike ther server, it can run on any machine who wishes to. +
In fact, the client side is simply a python library that interact with the werver using JSON-RPC (v2), hence if needed, anyone can write a library on any other language that will interact with the server ins the very same way.


==== `CTRexClient` module initialization

As explained, `CTRexClient` is the main module to use when writing an T-Rex test-plan. +
This module holds the entire interaction with T-Rex server, and result contiaing via `result_obj`, which is an instance of `CTRexResult` class. +
The `CTRexClient` instance is initialized in the following way:

  1. **T-Rex hostname**: represents the hostname on which the server is listening. Both hostname or IPv4 address will be a valid input.

  2. **Server port**: the port on which the server listens to incoming client requests. This parameter value must be identical to `port` option configured in the server.

  3. **History size**: The number of saved T-Rex samples. Based on this "window", some extra statistics and data are calculated. Default history size is 100 samples.

  4. **verbose **: This boolean option will prompt extended output, if available, of each of the activated methods. For any method that interacts with T-Rex server, this will prompt the JSON-RPC request and response. + 
  This option is especially useful for developers who wishes to imitate the functionality of this client using other programming languages.

**That's it!** +
Once these parameter has been passed, you're ready to interact woth T-Rex.

[NOTE] 
The most common initialization will simply use the hostname, such that common initilization lookes like: + 
`trex = CTRexClient('trex_host_name')`

==== `CTRexClient` module usage

This section covers with great detail the usage of the client module. Each of the methods describes are class methods of `CTRexClient`.

  - **`start_trex (f, d, block_to_success, timeout, trex_cmd_options)`** +
    Issue a request to start T-Rex with certain configuration. The server will only handle the request if the T-Rex is in `Idle` status. +
    Once the status has been confirmed, T-Rex server will issue for this single client a token, so that only that client may abort running T-Rex session. +
    `f` and `d` parameters are mandatory, as they are crutial parameter in setting T-Rex bahviour. Also, `d` parameter must be at least 30 seconds or larger.
    By default (and by design) this method **blocks** until T-Rex status changes to either 'Running' or back to 'Idle'.

  - **`stop_trex()`** +
    If (and only if) a certain client issued a run requested (and it accepted), this client may use this command to abort current run. + 
    This option is very useful especially when the real-time data from the T-Rex are utilized.

  - **`wait_until_kickoff_finish(timeout = 40)`** +
    This method blocks until T-Rex T-Rex status changes to 'Running'. In case of error an exception will be thrown. +
    The 'timeout' parameter sets the maximum waiting time. +
    This method is especially useful when `block_to_success` was set to false in order to utilize the time to configure other things, such as DUT. 

  - **`is_running(dump_out = False)`** +
    Checks if there's currently T-Rex session up (with any client). +
    If T-Rex is running, this method returns `True` and the result object id updated accordingly. +
    If not running, return `False`. +
    If a dictionary pointer is given in `dump_out` argument, the pointer object is cleared and the latest dump stored in it.

  - **`get_running_status()`** +
    Fetches the current T-Rex status. +
    Three possible states

      * `Idle` - No T-Rex session is currently running.

      * `Starting` - A T-Rex session just started (turns into Running after stability condition is reached)

      * `Running` - T-Rex session is currently active.

  The following diagram describes the state machine of T-Rex:

ifdef::backend-docbook[]
image::images/trex_control_plane_state_machine.png[title="T-Rex running state machine",align="center",width=280, link="images/trex_control_plane_state_machine.png"]
endif::backend-docbook[]

ifdef::backend-xhtml11[]
image::images/trex_control_plane_state_machine.png[title="T-Rex running state machine",align="center",width=400, link="images/trex_control_plane_state_machine.png"]
endif::backend-xhtml11[] 

  - **`get_running_info()`** +
    This method performs single poll of T-Rex running data and process it into the result object (named `result_obj`). +
    The method returns the most updated data dump from T-Rex in the form of Python dictionary. +
    +
    Behind the scenes, running that method will trigger inner-client process over the saved window, and produce window-relevant inforamtion, as well as get the most important data moe accessible. +
    Once the data has been fetched (at sample rate the satisfies the user), a custom data manipulation can be done in various forms and techniques footnote:[See `CTRexResult` module usage for more details]. +
    **Note: ** the sampling rate is bounded from buttom to 2 samples/sec.

  - **`sample_until_condition(condition_func, time_between_samples = 5)`** +
    This method automatically sets ongoing sampling of T-Rex data, with sampling rate described by `time_between_samples`. On each fetched dump, the `condition_func` is applied on the result objects, and if returns `True`, the sampling will stop. +
    On success (condition has been met), this method returns the latest result object that satisfied the given condition. +
    ON fail, this method will raise `UserWarning` exception.

  - **`sample_to_run_finish(time_between_samples = 5)`** +
    This method automatically sets ongoing sampling of T-Rex data with sampling rate described by `time_between_samples` until T-Rex run finished.

  - **`get_result_obj()`** +
    Returns a pointer to the result object of the client instance. + 
    Hence, this method returns the result object on which all the data processing takes place. 

TIP: The window stats (calculated when `get_running_info()` triggered) are very helpful in eliminate 'spikes' behavior in numerical values which might float from other data. 

==== `CTRexResult` module usage

This section covers how to use `CTRexResult` module to access into T-Rex data and post processing results, taking place at the client side whenever a data is polled from the server. +
The most important data structure in this module is the `history` object, which contains the sampled information (plus the post processing step) of each sample.

Most of the class methods are getters that enables an easy access to the most commonly used when working with T-Rex. These getters are called with self-explained names, such as `get_max_latency`. +
However, on top to these methods, the class offers data accessibility using the rest of the class methods. +
These methods are:

  - **`is_done_warmup()`** +
    This will return `True` only if T-Rex has reached its expected transmission bandwidth footnote:[A 3% deviation is allowed.]. +
    This parameter is important since in most cases, the most relevent test cases are interesting when T-Rex produces its expected TX, based on which the platform is tested and benchmerked.

  - **`get_latest_dump()`** +
    Fetches the latest polled dump saved in history.

  - **`get_last_value (tree_path_to_key, regex = None)`** +
    Fetch, out of the latest data dump a value. 

  - **`get_value_list (tree_path_to_key, regex = None)`** +
    Fetch, out of all data dumps stored in history a value. 
    
  - **History data access API** +
    Since (as metioned earlier) the data dump is a JSON-RPC string, which is decoded into Python dictionaries and lists, nested within each other. +
    This "Mini API" is used by both `get_last_value` and `get_value_list` methods, and receives in both cases two arguments: `tree_path_to_key, regex` footnote:[By default, `regex` argument is set to None]. +
    The user may choose whatever value he wishes to extract, using the `tree_path_to_key` argument. 

      * In order to get deeper and deeper on the hierarchy, use the key of the dictionary, separated by dot (‘'.'’) for each level. +
        In order to fetch more than one key in a certain dictionary (no matter how deep it is nested), use the `regex` argument to state which keys are to be included.
        Example: In order to fetch only the `expected_tx` key values of the latest dump, we'll call: *`get_last_value("trex-global.data", "m_tx_expected_\w+")`* +
        This will produce the following dictionary result: +
        *`{'m_tx_expected_pps': 21513.6, 'm_tx_expected_bps': 100416760.0, 'm_tx_expected_cps': 412.3}`* +
        We can see that the result is every key-value pair, found at the relevant tree-path and matches the provided regex.

      * In order to access an array element, specifying the `key_to_array[i]`, where `i` is the desired array index. +
        Example: In order to access the third element of the data array of: +
        `{“template_info” :  {"name":"template_info","type":0,"data":["avl/delay_10_http_get_0.pcap","avl/delay_10_http_post_0.pcap",` *`"avl/delay_10_https_0.pcap"`* `,"avl/delay_10_http_browsing_0.pcap",  "avl/delay_10_exchange_0.pcap","avl/delay_10_mail_pop_0.pcap","avl/delay_10_mail_pop_1.pcap","avl/delay_10_mail_pop_2.pcap","avl/delay_10_oracle_0.pcap"]}`  +
        we'll use the following command: `get_last_value("template_info.data[2]”)`. +
        This will produce the following result: +
        *`avl/delay_10_https_0.pcap`* +

        
== Usage Examples

=== Exmaple #1: Checking T-Rex status and Launching T-Rex

The following program checks T-Rex status, and later on launches it, querying its status along different time slots.

[source, python]
----
import time

trex = CTRexClient('trex-name')  
print "Before Running, T-Rex status is: ", trex.is_running()           # <1>
print "Before Running, T-Rex status is: ", trex.get_running_status()   # <2>

ret = trex.start_trex( c = 2,                        # <3>  
        m = 0.1,
        d = 40,
        f = 'avl/sfr_delay_10_1g.yaml',
        nc = True,
        p = True,
        l = 1000)

print "After Starting, T-Rex status is: ", trex.is_running(), trex.get_running_status()

time.sleep(10)  # <4>

print "Is T-Rex running? ", trex.is_running(), trex.get_running_status() # <5>
----

<1> `is_running()` returns a boolean and checks if T-Rex is running or not.

<2> `get_running_status()` returns a Python dictionary with T-Rex state, along with a verbose field containing extra info, if available.

<3> T-Rex lanching. All types of inputs are supported. Some fields (such as 'f' and 'd' are mandatory).

<4> Going to sleep for few seconds, allowing T-Rex to start.

<5> Checking out with T-Rex status again, printing both a boolean return value and a full status.

This code will prompt the following output, assuming a server was launched on the T-Rex machine.

----
Connecting to T-Rex @ http://trex-dan:8090/ ...
Before Running, T-Rex status is:  False
Before Running, T-Rex status is:  {u'state': <TRexStatus.Idle: 1>, u'verbose': u'T-Rex is Idle'}
                                                      <1>                             <1>

After Starting, T-Rex status is:  False {u'state': <TRexStatus.Starting: 2>, u'verbose': u'T-Rex is starting'}
                                                      <1>                             <1>
Is T-Rex running?  True {u'state': <TRexStatus.Running: 3>, u'verbose': u'T-Rex is Running'}
                                                      <1>                             <1>
----

<1> When looking at T-Rex status, both an enum status (`Idle, Starting, Running`) and verbose output are available.


=== Exmaple #2: Checking T-Rex status and Launching T-Rex with 'BAD PARAMETERS'

The following program checks T-Rex status, and later on launches it with wrong input ('mdf' is not legal option), hence T-Rex run will not start and a message will be available.

[source, python]
----
import time

trex = CTRexClient('trex-name')  
print "Before Running, T-Rex status is: ", trex.is_running()           # <1>
print "Before Running, T-Rex status is: ", trex.get_running_status()   # <2>

ret = trex.start_trex( c = 2,                        # <3>  
#<4>     mdf = 0.1,
        d = 40,
        f = 'avl/sfr_delay_10_1g.yaml',
        nc = True,
        p = True,
        l = 1000)

print "After Starting, T-Rex status is: ", trex.is_running(), trex.get_running_status()

time.sleep(10)  # <5>

print "Is T-Rex running? ", trex.is_running(), trex.get_running_status() # <6>
----

<1> `is_running()` returns a boolean and checks if T-Rex is running or not.

<2> `get_running_status()` returns a Python dictionary with T-Rex state, along with a verbose field containing extra info, if available.

<3> T-Rex lanching. All types of inputs are supported. Some fields (such as 'f' and 'c' are mandatory).

<4> Wrong parameter ('mdf') injected.

<5> Going to sleep for few seconds, allowing T-Rex to start.

<6> Checking out with T-Rex status again, printing both a boolean return value and a full status.

This code will prompt the following output, assuming a server was launched on the T-Rex machine.
----
Connecting to T-Rex @ http://trex-dan:8090/ ...
Before Running, T-Rex status is:  False
Before Running, T-Rex status is:  {u'state': <TRexStatus.Idle: 1>, u'verbose': u'T-Rex is Idle'}
                                                      <1>                             <1>

After Starting, T-Rex status is:  False {u'state': <TRexStatus.Starting: 2>, u'verbose': u'T-Rex is starting'}
                                                      <1>                             <1>
Is T-Rex running?  False {u'state': <TRexStatus.Idle: 1>, u'verbose': u'T-Rex run failed due to wrong input parameters, or due to reachability issues.'}
                                                      <2>                             <2>
----

<1> When looking at T-Rex status, both an enum status (`Idle, Starting, Running`) and verbose output are available.
 
<2> After T-Rex lanuching failed, a message indicating the failure reason. However, T-Rex is back Idle, ready to handle another launching request.


=== Exmaple #3: Launching T-Rex, let it run until custom condition is satisfied

The following program will launch T-Rex, and poll its result data until custom condition function returns `True`. + In this case, the condition function is simply named `condition`. + 
Once the condition is met, T-Rex run will be terminated.

[source, python]
----
print "Before Running, T-Rex status is: ", trex.get_running_status()

    print "Starting T-Rex..."
    ret = trex.start_trex( c = 2, 
        mdf = 0.1,
        d = 1000,
        f = 'avl/sfr_delay_10_1g.yaml',
        nc = True,
        p = True,
        l = 1000)

    def condition (result_obj): #<1>
        return result_obj.get_current_tx_rate()['m_tx_pps'] > 200000

    res = trex.sample_until_condition(condition) #<2>

    print res #<3>
    val_list = res.get_value_list("trex-global.data", "m_tx_expected_\w+") #<4>
----

<1> The `condition` function defines when to stop T-Rex. In this case, when T-Rex's current tx (in pps) exceeds 200000.
 
<2> The condition is passed to `sample_until_condition` method, which will block until either the condition is met or an 'Exception' is raised.

<3> Once satisfied, `res` variable holds the first result object on which the condition satisfied. At this point, T-Rex status is 'Idle' and another run can be requested from the server.

<4> Further custom processing can be made on the result object, regardless of other T-Rex runs.

<<<

=== Exmaple #4: Launching T-Rex, monitor live data and stopping on demand

The following program will launch T-Rex, and while it runs poll the server (every 5 seconds) for running inforamtion, such as latency, drops, and other extractable parameters. +
Then, after some criteria was met, T-Rex execution is terminated, enabeling others to use the resource instead of waiting for the entire execution to finish.
    
[source, python]
----
print "Before Running, T-Rex status is: ", trex.get_running_status()

    print "Starting T-Rex..."
    ret = trex.start_trex( c = 2, 
        mdf = 0.1,
        d = 100,
        f = 'avl/sfr_delay_10_1g.yaml',
        nc = True,
        p = True,
        l = 1000)

    last_res = dict()
    while trex.is_running(dump_out = last_res): #<1>
        print '\n\n*****************************************'
        print "RECEIVED DUMP:"
        print last_res, "\n\n\n"

        print "CURRENT RESULT OBJECT"
        obj = trex.get_result_obj()
   #<2> # Custom data processing is done here, for example:                
        print obj.get_value_list("trex-global.data.m_tx_bps")      
        time.sleep(5) #<3>

    print "Terminating T-Rex..."
    ret = trex.stop_trex()  #<4>                             
----

<1> Iterate as long as T-Rex is running. + 
    In this case the latest dump is also saved into `last_res` variable, so easier access for that data is available, although not needed most of the time.

<2> Data processing. This is fully customizable for the relevant test initiated.

<3> The sampling rate is flexibale and can be configured depending on the desired output.

<4> T-Rex termination.

=== Exmaple #5: Launching T-Rex, let it run until finished

The following program will launch T-Rex, and poll it automatically until run finishes. The polling rate is customisable (in this case, every 10 seconds) using `time_between_samples` argument.

[source, python]
----
print "Before Running, T-Rex status is: ", trex.get_running_status()

    print "Starting T-Rex..."
   ret = trex.start_trex( c = 2,  #<1>
        mdf = 0.1,
        d = 1000,
        f = 'avl/sfr_delay_10_1g.yaml',
        nc = True,
        p = True,
        l = 1000)

    res = trex.sample_to_run_finish(time_between_samples = 10) #<2>

    print res #<3>
    val_list = res.get_value_list("trex-global.data", "m_tx_expected_\w+") #<4>

<1> T-Rex run initialization.
 
<2> Define the sample rate and block until T-Rex run ends. Once this method returns (assuming no error), T-Rex result object will contain the samples collected allong T-Rex run, limited to the history size footnoteref:[For example, For example for history sized 100 only the latest 100 samples will be available despite sampling more than that during T-Rex run.].

<3> Once finished, `res` variable holds the latest result object.

<4> Further custom processing can be made on the result object, regardless of other T-Rex runs.
